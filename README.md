# Alveoli-store
Alveoli-Store is a playful SQLite demo project inspired by respiratory systems. It demonstrates connecting to a database, creating tables, inserting dynamic user records, fetching with SELECT queries, updating and deleting entries, and using parameterized queries to ensure security. Results are displayed clearly with proper commits and closures.
